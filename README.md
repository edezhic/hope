# Hope
Human-oriented programming environment

This project is about making a 'programming language' with intuitive syntax to make it human-readable for anyone, not just software engineers. You can find an example of such "code" and rust core part compiled into wasm module [on the github pages](https://edezhic.github.io/Hope/). Current targets: interpreter, basic operations, networking(+p2p?), some cryptography and PWA IDE.
