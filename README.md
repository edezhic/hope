# Hope
Human-oriented programming environment

This project is about making a 'programming language' with intuitive syntax to make it human-readable for anyone, not just software engineers. You can find an example of such "code" and rust core part compiled into wasm module [on the github pages](https://edezhic.github.io/Hope/). Current targets: interpreter, basic operations, networking(+p2p?), some cryptography and PWA IDE.

Milestones for v1.0:
* pandas-like data mangling
* functionality for distributed teams/companies
* possibility of moving the repo and development process through the Hope itself using some kind of distributed protocol
* court/election-like functionality
* automl?

(Very) Questionable ideas:
* Support for WASM/WebGPU modules, for high-performance custom logic, ML and compatability with modules written in other languages while keeping them sandboxed for security
* Hope OS, based on or merged with Redox (or smth alike). Hopes as a replacement for shell.
* SNARKs and homomorphic encryption primitives
* And many others
